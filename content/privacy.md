# Privacy Policy

Really, there is not a lot to say about keeping your information private when we are talking about a book. This book contains information being shared with you, the reader. If I was to keep this private we would not be here.

In so far as someone asking me if you read this book, there is no user tracking, so how would I know who did or did not read it?

Rest assured, you reading this privacy policy will be kept, well, private.
